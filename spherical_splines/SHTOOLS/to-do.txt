1. Make a configuration file to determine if underscores need to be appended to LAPACK and FFTW routine names.
2. Rewrite the Legendre functions such that they are accurate beyond degree 2800.
3. Rewrite the spherical harmonic rotation routines such that they are done using real harmonics as in Blanco et al. (1997).
4. Parallelize routines such as SHExpandGLQ, SHExpandDH, MakeGridDH, MakeGridGLQ.

a. allow MakeGravGrid to output maps in geodetic coordinates.
c. change NormalGravity to allow either geocentric or geodetic latitude.
d. ask ipgp for domain name shtools.ipgp.fr, if not buy shtools.net
e. configure file
